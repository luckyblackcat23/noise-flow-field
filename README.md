# noise-flow-field

## instructions:
* create an empty GameObject
* place script onto the object
* create a prefab cube, that has a scale of 0.5x, 2y (feel free to play with these variables) and drag that into the prefeb variable of the script
* enjoy the weirdly artistic chaos :D

feel free to use this script for anything you may need
